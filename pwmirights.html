        <p class="u-text u-text-2">Rights of persons with mental illness are many times only violated because they are not aware of it. Mental Healthcare Act lists rights of persons with mental illness comprehensively from section 18 to 28. A good summary of&nbsp; the legal rights is present in the following article.&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.ipleaders.in/legal-rights-of-persons-with-mental-illness/" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-1">Legal Rights of the persons with Mental Illnesses- A detailed study (ipleaders.in)</a>

            <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; background-color: #f2f2f2; color: #111111; font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif;">. The government of India through National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) provisions for free legal aid to the persons with mental illness as per 27(1)&nbsp; and 27(2) of the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 as well as 12(d) of Legal Services Authority Act, 1987. To apply for free legal services, one can either directly visit the Court premises in any of District Court, High Court or Supreme Court where they would be directed by the front office for further processes. The same can be applied online by visiting this portal&nbsp;</span>

            <span style="font-weight: 700;">Right to communicate outside</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700;">and have visitors (including Lawyers)</span>
            <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; background-color: #f2f2f2; color: #111111; font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif;"> As per section 26 of the Mental Healthcare Act, every person admitted in a mental health establishment has a right to have visitors which includes friends, family members as well as lawyers. Not allowing to meet a lawyer is a violation of section 26 of Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 as well as a violation of Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is also illegal to take away mobile phones from patients or not allowing to make them phone calls/ emails to police or lawyers or authorities or anyone as per section 26 of the act.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

              <span style="font-weight: 700;">Right to refuse treatment:</span>
            </span>
            <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; background-color: #f2f2f2; color: #111111; font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif;"> One of the landmark features of the Mental Healthcare Act 2017 is consent of the patient. According to section 4 of the Mental Healthcare Act 2017, every person, especially an adult, by default, must be assumed to have capacity to decide whether they wish to receive treatment or not. If consent is being violated or medications are being forced or if the person feels that admission was wrong, they can either immediately make an application to the mental health review board, which will then make a decision based on evidence and may order discharge if so found that admission was wrong. It will be the duty of treating psychiatrist to establish that the person didn't have capacity to consent to treatment. In that case, the consent of family member or their diagnosis alone is not sufficient as per the law. If decision of board&nbsp; is unsatisfactory it can even be challenged in high court and in that case it is best to contact a lawyer. Nothing in law stops a person from directly contacting a lawyer for speedy processes. <br>

            <span style="font-weight: 700;">Mentally ill or disabled are entitled to their own medical records</span> :&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; background-color: #f2f2f2; color: #111111; font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif;">Indian law allows patients to view or access or get copy of their medical records. This is provisioned by not only Mental Healthcare Act, 2017, but also by Right to Information Act, 2005, Consumer Protection Act, 2019 as well as National Medical Council Act, 2019 which issued Indian Medical Council Regulations according to which the medical records must be provided within 72 hours of receipt of information. Only under exceptional circumstances can a psychiatrist deny a person with mental illness their right to access their own medical records as per the MHCA 2017. Even in that case, the person can make an application to the district mental health review board to release the information.<br>
              <br>However, it is often the case that patients are not allowed to access their own medical records, especially during inpatient treatment, which is a serious violation of all four laws and the same can be brought to the attention of respective authorities provided by the 4 laws. While Consumer Protection Act can only be brought up in a consumer court, the other three anyone can directly invoke. Filing a RTI application is as simple as filling up the form on "Submit Request" Tab on the following link, if the hospital is under central government.&nbsp;<a href="https://rtionline.gov.in/" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-4">RTI Online :: Home | Submit RTI Request | Submit RTI First Appeal | View RTI Status | RTI FAQ</a>
              <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; background-color: #f2f2f2; color: #111111; font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif;">If the hospital is under state government, an offline application by post can be made along with a postal order or demand draft of Rs. 10.&nbsp; Click here to download a sample RTI application for accessing medical records. Upon not providing medical records, the RTI applicant can make first appeal and then second appeal. The other two applications one has to directly write to the treating physician.&nbsp;<br>
